# calendar-app
##Objective:
Build a calendar application using client-side JavaScript.
Allow the user choose between a weekly view or monthly view on the calendar.
Allow the user to navigate to previous and next weeks/months respectively.
In month-view, the number of events shall be displayed.
In the week view, the text of those events shall be displayed.
Persist events across the calendar as the user navigates from month to month.
Do this all without a server, and without the page ever refreshing.
Build in good, object oriented code.
As a stretch, implement Angular 2.

Let's get after it. Calendar is hosted at: http://calendar-application-challenge.herokuapp.com/index.html

Tech Used:
JavaScript.
